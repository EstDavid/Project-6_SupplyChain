# Cacaco & Chocolate supply chain project

This repository contains an Ethereum DApp the demonstrates a Supply Chain flow from the moment a cacao farmer harvests the beans, to the moment a consumer purchases the chocolate made with those beans.

## Roles
There are 4 different roles in this DApp, apart from the owner of the contract:
- Farmer => A Farmer is able to harvest beans and provide the batch with the data of the Farm (Name, Information, Latitude and Longitude, as well as Notes about the bacth itself). After harvesting them, the Farmer is able to process them, pack them and then set a price and put them for sale.
- Factory => A Factory is able to buy beans which are for sale, grind them, make chocolate and them ship the chocolate to a Distributor of their choice. 
- Distributor => A Distributor is able to receive chocolate, give it a brand of their choice and put it up for sale.
- Consumer => A Consumer is able to purchase chocolate from a Distributor




# Supply chain & data auditing

This repository containts an Ethereum DApp that demonstrates a Supply Chain flow between a Seller and Buyer. The user story is similar to any commonly used supply chain process. A Seller can add items to the inventory system stored in the blockchain. A Buyer can purchase such items from the inventory system. Additionally a Seller can mark an item as Shipped, and similarly a Buyer can mark an item as Received.

The DApp User Interface when running should look like...

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure you've already installed ganache-cli, Truffle and enabled MetaMask extension in your browser.

```
Give examples (to be clarified)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/nd1309/tree/master/course-5/project-6
```

Change directory to ```project-6``` folder and install all requisite npm packages (as listed in ```package.json```):

```
cd project-6
npm install
```

Launch Ganache:

```
ganache-cli -m "spirit supply whale amount human item harsh scare congress discover talent hamster"
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/ganache-cli.png)

In a separate terminal window, Compile smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_compile.png)

This will create the smart contract artifacts in folder ```build\contracts```.

Migrate smart contracts to the locally running blockchain, ganache-cli:

```
truffle migrate
```

Your terminal should look something like this:

![truffle test](images/truffle_migrate.png)

Test smart contracts:

```
truffle test
```

All 10 tests should pass.

In a separate terminal window, launch the DApp:

```
npm run dev
```
